# flask-taskapp
Application of CRUD type tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

This application is developed with the Python programming language, it uses a framework called Flask. The structure is logically built in HTML and the Bootstrap v5 framework was used to style it, which provides a simple, elegant and pleasant design. The database used for this project is MySQL.

Below, I share some images of the application interface.
