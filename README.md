# flask-taskapp
Application of CRUD type tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

This application is developed with the Python programming language and uses a framework called Flask. The structure of the application is built in HTML, to style it, the Bootstrap framework was used, which provides a simple, elegant and pleasant design. A few lines of JavaScript code were also used to hide alert messages. The database used for this project is MySQL.

Below, I share some screenshots of the application interface.
